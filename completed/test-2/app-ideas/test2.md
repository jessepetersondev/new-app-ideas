# Test 2

A simple web app to track daily expenses.

## Features
- Add expenses with category, amount, date
- View monthly summary
- Simple pie chart of spending by category
- Export to CSV

## Tech
- React frontend
- Local storage for data
```

**Important:** The `# Title` (H1 header) becomes the app name. So this creates an app called `expense-tracker`.

## What Gets Ignored

- `README.md` - always skipped
- `LICENSE.md` - always skipped
- Files without an H1 header (`# Title`) - skipped
- Any non-`.md` files - skipped

---

## Quick Setup

1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `my-app-ideas`)
2. Create an `ideas` folder
3. Add a `.md` file with your first app idea
4. Configure the repo URL in App Queue settings
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-app-ideas.git
