# WinStreak 

A super simple, addictive web app that turns your daily walks into competitive fun by automatically tracking steps (via phone sensors) and letting you battle friends or random opponents for weekly "win streaks."

Overview
WinStreak gamifies walking by awarding points for consecutive days of step goals met, with viral leaderboards, daily challenges, and silly badges like "Sloth Slayer" for beating lazy opponents. Users connect with friends via social login for private leagues or join public "streaks" for bragging rights. It's designed for instant gratification—launch in days using no-code tools, monetize via premium streaks or ads.
​

Key Features
Auto Step Tracking: Background phone integration (no wearables needed); customizable goals (e.g., 5K steps/day).

Streak Battles: 1v1 or group challenges; lose a day, lose the streak—opponents steal your points.

​
