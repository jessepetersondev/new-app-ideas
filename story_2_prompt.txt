## Story 2: TypeScript Type Definitions
**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** Small
**Dependencies:** None

### Description
Create TypeScript interfaces for the virality prediction system including the prediction response structure, API request/response types, and usage statistics.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `ViralityPrediction` interface defines complete prediction structure
- [ ] `PredictionRequest` interface defines API input
- [ ] `PredictionResponse` interface defines API output
- [ ] `UsageStats` interface defines usage tracking data
- [ ] All factor sub-types (sentiment, hashtags, length, emojis, buzzwords) are properly typed

### Implementation Notes
- Create new types directory if it doesn't exist
- Use discriminated unions for sentiment label (positive/negative/neutral)
- Make suggestion array typed as `string[]`

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/types/prediction.ts` - Create new file with all prediction-related types
