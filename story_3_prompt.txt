## Story 3: Usage Tracking API Endpoint
**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** Small
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 2

### Description
Create an API endpoint that returns the current user's usage statistics including their tier, today's prediction count, and remaining predictions.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GET `/api/usage` returns user's current tier (always "free" for MVP)
- [ ] Response includes todayCount of predictions made today
- [ ] Response includes dailyLimit (3 for free tier)
- [ ] Response includes remainingToday calculation
- [ ] Endpoint requires authentication
- [ ] Returns 401 for unauthenticated requests

### Implementation Notes
- Query usageTracking table filtered by userId and today's date
- Use BetterAuth to get session and user ID
- Free tier limit is 3 predictions per day (use env var NEXT_PUBLIC_FREE_DAILY_LIMIT)

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/app/api/usage/route.ts` - Create new GET handler
