## Story 6: Tweet Input Component
**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Story 5

### Description
Create a reusable tweet input component with character counter, visual feedback approaching the limit, and clear functionality.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Textarea accepts text input up to 280 characters
- [ ] Character counter displays current/max (e.g., "142/280")
- [ ] Counter changes color when approaching limit (250+ = warning)
- [ ] Counter changes color when at limit (280 = error/red)
- [ ] Clear button resets the input
- [ ] Component exposes value and onChange props
- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Is accessible (proper labels, ARIA attributes)

### Implementation Notes
- Use controlled component pattern with value/onChange
- Use Tailwind classes for color transitions
- Consider adding subtle animation when near limit

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/predict/tweet-input.tsx` - Create new component
